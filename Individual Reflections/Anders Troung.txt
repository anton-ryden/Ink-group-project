Giving suggestions of APIs we could use for our applications, opening a discussion whether to use JavaFX or Java Swing and challenge ourselves to

Discuss how to collect data from the internet, and how to process the data to learn of its poverty status.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
We tried to be the product owner of someone else's user story to verify what we had delivered. I discussed with the group member
that it would be best if people was working by themselves instead of groups of two. The reason is that we could split larger user stories
into even smaller ones to share the workload.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I created the information panel on the right side of the panel which was taking data from an open source on the internet and
processing the data to give out a percentage of the population living in poverty


Week 5 -------------------------------------------

How the other in the team implemented the countries in the application so I can work on my part to make it easier to merge with my task.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Assisting the members who tried to make the coloring feature for our map, as it was connected to the information panel I did in earlier sprint.
I had to rewrite the code and optimize it before merging with other branches.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Discussing how the use of dividing the members by epics could not work anymore because assigning product owner early caused some problem since
some was product owner of their own user story they had the responsibility to implement. However we became more lenient when having a product owner for
each user story and became more like having the group to agree if a story looks good enough.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I made the coloring of the map depending on its poverty status. Initially I had another task but was postponed since someone else in my group
had problem integrating my information panel with the coloring of the map. That is why I had to rewrite my code to being able to easily color maps.
