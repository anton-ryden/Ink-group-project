Week 1 -------------------------------------------

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Cooperation in a group efficiently with an even workload for everyone.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Let everyone in the group have a voice in it and share their opinion

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We have yet not used Scrum in our practices.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Working towards the social contracts that we all agree on together with the team

A: Current situation
Early planning phase, we began to discuss how we will work as a group.

B: What might or should be
It would be nice if everyone had the same expectation and goal for our course.

C: A plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be
Attending exercises and lectures together


Week 2 -------------------------------------------
What do I want to learn or understand better?
Understanding how to access and use an open data source

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Discuss with how the interactive map works and how to integrate our information panel feature with the map.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We have not begun using scrum yet.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I gave ideas how to divide the role of members being responsible for user stories and product owners.

A: Current situation
A lot of planning, using a drawing application to show how our application will look like.

B: What might or should be
We could make the structure more clear of using technical documentations. However we discarded the use of class diagram
since our code are subject to change

C: A plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be
Use a technical documentation and frequently update it whenever the structure of our code changes.

Week 3 -------------------------------------------
What do I want to learn or understand better?
How to plan efficiently using technical documentations for example class diagram. We made an attempt but we faced a lot of difficulties
since we were unsure of how the structure of the code will be apart from the usage of MVC pattern.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Giving suggestions of APIs we could use for our applications, opening a discussion whether to use JavaFX or Java Swing and challenge ourselves to
try out a new API.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
This week I made sure the user stories had an acceptance criteria, and members were assigned to be product owners for some stories.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I began with the creation of the trello board and contributed towards creating the user stories and epics for our application.

A: Current situation
Discussing how our code will be implemented, and making API decisions. However, we were slightly behind with our work as a hello world demo should be created already.

B: What might or should be
We should have started coding and make a foundations for our code structure.

C: A plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be
Start coding a hello world demo but applied with MVC pattern and the APIs that we will use for our application.

Week 4 -------------------------------------------
What do I want to learn or understand better?
How to collect data from an open source on the internet.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Discuss how to collect data from the internet, and how to process the data to learn of its poverty status.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
We tried to be the product owner of someone else's user story to verify what we had delivered. I discussed with the group member
that it would be best if people was working by themselves instead of groups of two. The reason is that we could split larger user stories
into even smaller ones to share the workload.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I created the information panel on the right side of the panel which was taking data from an open source on the internet and
processing the data to give out a percentage of the population living in poverty

A: Current situation
We caught up a lot for this week when everyone has started implementing their code for their user story.

B: What might or should be
Instead of having two on every user story, we could divide tasks even smaller and have every individual working on a user story.

C: A plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be
Discuss on the upcoming sprint and try see if it works better.

Week 5 -------------------------------------------
What do I want to learn or understand better?
How the other in the team implemented the countries in the application so I can work on my part to make it easier to merge with my task.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Assisting the members who tried to make the coloring feature for our map, as it was connected to the information panel I did in earlier sprint.
I had to rewrite the code and optimize it before merging with other branches.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Discussing how the use of dividing the members by epics could not work anymore because assigning product owner early caused some problem since
some was product owner of their own user story they had the responsibility to implement. However we became more lenient when having a product owner for
each user story and became more like having the group to agree if a story looks good enough.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I made the coloring of the map depending on its poverty status. Initially I had another task but was postponed since someone else in my group
had problem integrating my information panel with the coloring of the map. That is why I had to rewrite my code to being able to easily color maps.


A: Current situation
Miscommunications on how open source data will be collected and stored. Bad coding structure which caused slow performance on the application.

B: What might or should be
We should have a discussion on what API we should use. It worked good between JavaFX and Java Swing since we made it clear among ourselves that everyone
in the group would use JavaFX. However how the data will be stored had not been discussed at all.

C: A plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be
Communicate more and talk about how it goes for someone and what they are planning to do, so we could discuss if someone are about to implement a wrong API.

Week 6 -------------------------------------------
What do I want to learn or understand better?
To understand what the other members have done and how I could implement my user story with their code.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Discuss with each other and try understanding how my teammates worked on their part.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Help planning the upcoming part and create more user stories that everyone could work on.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I made a donation panel connected to a database which could be registered by a user.

A: Current situation
I had a lot of difficulties for this sprint. I had to discuss with someone who were first designing the donation panel since we were both working
on a user story on a same panel. Afterwards I had some discussion with a teammate how they implemented the database, and another teammate of how they
implemented the user session. And lastly a discussion if we should keep the MVC design as it showed a lot of difficulties if I had to write several
different places in the code to keep up with the MVC pattern while getting my user story done. This was a frustrating user story where I had to check in
with several teammates before I could start working on my task.

B: What might or should be
Alternatively we could split or change the user story and make it less dependant on other stories, as this user story did not meet the INVEST criteria.

C: A plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be
I should have been more open with the group of my complications with the user story. As in our social contract we all agreed to ask for support if we met an
obstacle.


Week 7 -------------------------------------------
What do I want to learn or understand better?
Learning how to make queries to database to easily gather information instead of using a csv file.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Discuss how the design of the user page will be, what its purpose are and how that page will look like.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Giving suggestion and planning how the user page will look like and we eventually took a vote on that.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I created a user page where the user could see how much money they donated and how many healthy diets it corresponds to.

A: Current situation
The project is about to meet its finish line and we started to clean up our code. From my previous sprint. I reflected upon how to handle parts that
are dependant of other work by teammates. I left out smaller parts for them to easily connect their part of work together
with my task, that could be for example creating a button and make an unfinished button handler to run a part from my teammates code.

B: What might or should be
As above, user stories could be better planned to meet the INVEST criteria, in that way parts would not be that too dependant to each other.

C: A plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be
A discussion of how features could be implemented when creating a user story.

Week 8 -------------------------------------------
What do I want to learn or understand better?
Reflect on how we could work to do better on the next project.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Discuss the problem we had throughout the course period and what we could do to prevent it in the future

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Reflect on our use of scrum and what we could do for the next project.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
Working on the final report together

A: Current situation
Finishing our project, this sprint we worked mostly on documentation and reflections.
