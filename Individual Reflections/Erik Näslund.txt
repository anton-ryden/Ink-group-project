This is the weekly individual reflection of Erik Näslund. I will be updating this file each week with a reflection entry by answering each of the following questions:

1. what do I want to learn or understand better?
2. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
3. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
4. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?


--------- Week 1 -----------
what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn and understand how to work in a group better.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Right now our main goal is to understand working together as good as possible before we start working on the actual project.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I do not have any contribution towards the team's use of Scrum yet but when we start working on it 
i will make sure to have understood Scrum the best i can so i can help the team to use it correctly.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We have finished writing our Social Contract this week and my contribution was that i learned what it was and helped the team agree on what the social contract should include.

--------- Week 2 -----------

Questions 1-3 are the same as last week since we haven't really started working on the project yet.

4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week i planned when our meeting was to take place and helped create the project scope (business model and general idea 
of what we are going to do) as well as the mockup visual representation of the application.

--------- Week 3 -----------

what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to be able to understand how to create an interactable map based on JavaFX. It should be a map of the world where you are
able to zoom in on, highlight and select all countries. This will be a vital feature of our project.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By learning this myself i will be able to tell the other members of my group how it works and how they can use it to create what we want our end result to be.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been assigned as PO 2 other members tasks. I also helped lay the foundation and preparation for our first sprint next week.
That being estimating and planning what all members should work on in the upcomming sprint.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week we mostly laid the foundation of our project. I helped create various epics, user stories and estimating how much time each of those user stories should take. 
We also agreed on a clearer picture of what our end result for the project should be. We decided to devide the group into subgroups of 2. 
Me and Anton were decided to be one of those subgroups. Me and Anton have been working on and understanding creating an interactable map using javaFX.

--------- Week 4 -----------

what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to use data sources better which relates to my task in the upcomming sprint.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week I learned a lot about the map we are using for the project and also JavaFX. The information I've learned will allow
me to help others when they have questions relating those.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I helped book meetings and helped plan the upcomming sprint. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I worked with Anton to create the visible and interactable map. I also helped verify other group members tasks.

--------- Week 5 -----------

what do I want to learn or understand better?
I need to understand the map and the use of databases in java better in order to be able to do my tasks next week.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help them by explaining more about how the map works if they need that information since i have been working on the map a lot.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week i haven't been able to work as much as i would like to because of personal matters. So my contribution towards the
team's use of scrum is much lower than i would like it to be but i still managed to attend the meetings and helped a little bit
with the planning

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Since i haven't been able to work as much this week, i wasn't able to finish my deliveries for the week. I will do better next
week!

--------- Week 6 -----------


what do I want to learn or understand better?
I need to learn more about JavaFX and how to change the icon of the program since those are things i'm going to be working on next sprint.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
If i learn this it will hopefully be of use for the team. Otherwise i'm stil able to help them learn about the things i've learned from the project.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week i've helped plan meetings and seen to it that we follow our usual sprint schedule. Also planning the next sprint and asking questions to help other members paricipate more.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've fixed a bug and made some improvements to the database. I also tried to help other team members as much as i could and keep communication with them to make sure we are on track.
