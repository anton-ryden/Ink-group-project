This is the weekly individual reflection of Erik Näslund. I will be updating this file each week with a reflection entry by answering each of the following questions:

1. what do I want to learn or understand better?
2. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
3. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
4. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?


--------- Week 1 -----------
what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn and understand how to work in a group better.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Right now our main goal is to understand working together as good as possible before we start working on the actual project.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I do not have any contribution towards the team's use of Scrum yet but when we start working on it 
i will make sure to have understood Scrum the best i can so i can help the team to use it correctly.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We have finished writing our Social Contract this week and my contribution was that i learned what it was and helped the team agree on what the social contract should include.

--------- Week 2 -----------

Questions 1-3 are the same as last week since we haven't really started working on the project yet.

4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week i planned when our meeting was to take place and helped create the project scope (business model and general idea 
of what we are going to do) as well as the mockup visual representation of the application.

--------- Week 3 -----------
