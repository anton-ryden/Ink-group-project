Week 1:
* What do I want to learn or understand better?
I feel a little bit rusty on what it is we are learning this week so I want to get up-to-date with that.

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
To work and study together by asking each other questions.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We have not yet started using Scrum.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week we created the social contract and I helped by sharing my thoughts and ideas.
