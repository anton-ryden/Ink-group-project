Me and Michael are going to be working more closely together and I see us bouncing ideas with each other (whenever we get started) to learn new things.

I helped the group set up the Scrum board by creating and assigning user stories and estimating how long they will take.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Besides setting up our Scrum board, I helped the team to create a UML diagram to get a better idea of what our code structure will look like, I contributed to the team reflection, and I looked at different options for our map.
