Individual Reflections

WEEK 1:

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about the effectivity of using agile and Scrum methods for software projects.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By offering my knowledge and help but also figuring out stuff together.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Right now, none since we are at the start and I'm just getting used to it and figuring it out.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week we only had the Social Contract to send in so I've been working with the team to come up with a Social Contract that we all agree on.
