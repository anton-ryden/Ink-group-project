Team Reflection - Group Ink

Each entry will be about 1 week apart.

-------Entry 1 (WEEK 3)---------

This team reflection we discuss our application of scrum, design decisions and product structure and social contract and effort

Right now the scope of the project is rather small but we plan on expanding the further we go. the priority of features were discussed within the group. 
The features that are most vital for the project to work were labled with a higher priority and those that weren't with a lower. 

We haven't changed anything in our social contract but we have followed the rules it contains. Mainly booking meetings and everyone expressing their thoughts.
This week we spent about 7-8 hours and we believe we are on track. We have managed to set a foundation for our project and are ready for our first sprint.
Most importantly we want to learn as much as possible about working together in a group and programming. We will see this project as a success as long as the most vital user stories are completed.


We have decided to a class diagram to better agree on the structure of our code. We will mainly use trello for documentation, 
the trello will also be updated frequently whenever we think of something new or something that needs to be improved.
It will be difficult to ensure code quality but we will make sure to do rigorous testing and also have the PO check the final result if it works properly.

We devided the work in groups of 2. Where each group is responsible for several user stories. 
These user stories have an assigned PO which is one of the other groups. 
This allows us to work in smaller groups and share ideas/thoughts within your subgroup.
We used a trello board and took inspiration from a exercise session how the structure should look like. This made it possible
to come up with various epics and user stories.

-------Entry 2 (WEEK 4)---------

Customer Value and Scope:
This sprint we have been developing the feature to create accounts and a loginpage which includes a database and GUI. We also developed the feature to see the poverty status of a country by using an open data source. We've also created a visible map where you can click and zoom on the different countries to highlight them and see the name of the country. The priority of the features were prioritized as the order in the text.

For this week's sprint we achieved what we wanted to do this sprint which is the interactable map, the account/loginpage and being able to extract data about a certain country from an open data source. We discussed each others problems and came up with the best possible solutions that makes it easier to merge each feature into a complete application. This meant learning about how every feature was constructed so that every individual knows how to utilize each others functions/code. 

With effort estimation we divided the tasks evenly among the group members. Certain acceptance critera resulted in some group members being unable to progress their own feature without others finishing theirs. This resulted in a lot of communication between the group members and a lot of group members helping each other out with their tasks. 

Every PO checked the acceptance criteria for the tasks in this sprint and made sure that each feature worked as intented. The value of the acceptance tests are that they provide us with checkpoints that the project is going as intented and the epics are working as planned. 

The three KPIs we used are team velocity, team satisfaction and sprint burndown-chart. The sprint burndown-chart made us realise earlier in the week that we didn't have a lot of progress into the project which made us have to drastically increase the amount of work we put in this sprint for us to have a reasonable sprint burndown-chart. This resulted in a high team velocity and if this team velocity is kept up during the next few sprints, the project is estimated to be finished earlier than planned. The high team velocity also resulted in every group member fulfilling their role in the social contract. 

Social Contract and Effort:
We haven't changed anything in our social contract but we have followed the rules it contains.

This week we had three meetings with a total time of 10 hours where everyone participated and approximately 20 hours of working on the application. This week's hours were a lot higher because we were behind compared to the expected progress we were supposed to have at this sprint.

Design decisions and product structure:
We decided to use sqlite which is a more light weight database framework and easier to use/setup, thus makes it more user friendly. We've discussed architecture patterns briefly, mainly how features are going to be merged. We tried to make the application as graphical and user friendly/intuitive as possible

Documentation is something we really need to work on during next sprint since we've been slacking with it.

We haven't had the time to go through each others codes yet.

Application of Scrum:
We have a scrum master and everyone is at least PO for one user story each week. By having POs for user stories thats not their own, we ensureu the acceptance criteria are met. 

We have had a lot of meetings and used sprints. The meetings have been good for raising issues and asking about potential merge conflicts. During the meetings it's also easy to discuss potential problems you've had encountered.

This sprint every user story have had a PO assigned to them. No user story got rejected from the POs but feedback were given for most of them. 

We are all using the same IDE (Intellij) which also gives us the option to use the "Code With Me" plugin. We have been using Intellij for a long time however Code With Me was suggested by one of the team members so we learned to utilize it and it made things smoother to work on the same code.

Nothing from literature however a lot from the latest guest lecture. For example, making sure everyone participate in the meetings and not being afraid of poking for answers. Do not ask yes or no questions as a Scrum master. 

-------Entry 1 (WEEK 5)---------
Customer Value and Scope:
This sprint we have focused on mainly improving our features and small quality of life changes which includes more work with UI(Graphs displaying information, colors that signify how much a certain country is in Poverty), grabbing certain data from databases and being able to stay logged in with an account.

This sprint, we encountered quite a few problem however we feel that the teamwork has been good. We aren't really happy regarding the team velocity due to our user story application which resulted in slower work than usual as some stories depended on others. However this was also because everyone in the group had a chance to touch on eachothers code which takes time to get familiarized too.

Like last sprint, we divided the tasks in what we felt was fair amount the team members. This week was especially heavy on communication due to several big features being merged this week and worked upon which means that a certain level of understanding of eachothers code was neccessary. This resulted in a lot of questions and people communicating about their code and purpose.

This sprint was mainly adjusting the features and adding to them so that they would meet the PO's acceptance criteria and checkpoints.

Nothing has changed as of last week regarding KPIs.

Social Contract and Effort:
Regarding the social contract, that hasn't been altered but we followed the same rules that we set in week 1.

This week, we have put in around 20 hours of development and meetings. These hours were mostly due to meetings that involved in helping others understand eachothers code. 

Design decisions and product structure:
Our design decisions and product structures are the same as last week.
We haven't started documenting yet which is one of our main weaknesses that would have made communication a lot easier.
We have only discussed what kind of documentation we were gonna use which was Javadoc. We often communicate solutions during
difficult issues and try to choose the best and most convenient solution to ensure code quality.

Application of Scrum
Nothing has changed this week in terms of our application of scrum. 
We have however split a few user stories in to sub stories to make the user stories more independent which allowed for members to work
on separate features. 
-------Entry 1 (WEEK 6)---------
Customer Value and Scope
This sprint mainly revolved around the group optimizing the code which included gathering most information that was spread in different files in to a collective database. A lot of optimizations and changes had to be made regarding code that did not use databases and instead used other files to search for information such as CSV files. Some of the work this week also went in to planning the UI for our donation panel and implementing the UI. An example of this is the implementation of being able to check how many meals a certain amount of donation can provide. An additional feature that was incorporated to the map was a drag function that would allow you to zoom in and out at preference. A bug that involved the resizing of the window was also fixed. We have also worked on adding documentation to our code this week.

Compared to the previous sprints, this week has been a bit lacking in communication and we've also ran in to the same issues that occured last week which was some user stories not being entirely separate which resulted in some of the user stories that were being worked on this week to be reliant on other user stories to be finished.

This sprint, there werent as many tasks to divide but we still split them up in what we felt was fair with peoples interest on the task in to account. As usual the effort estimation and task breakdown ensured that everyone had a task assigned that we felt was proper and fair.

Our procedure hasn't changed but not everything has gone through the acceptance tests this week.

Our KPIs have remained unchanged.

Social Contract and EFfort:
No changes have been made to the social contract.

This week a bit less work was put in which resulted in around 16-17 hours which is a decrease from the previous weeks. This was mostly due to our sprint having its work revolved around existing features and mostly optimising. This meant less research in to newer things to add which decreased the amount of time taken. 

Design descisions and product structure:
Nothing has changed in this area.
We have started documenting with Javadoc quite a bit and commented on the majority of code now. Our code quality and enforcing coding standards are made by the project owners overlooking that the features are easy to implement and effective to use.

Application of Scrum:
Nothing drastic has changed, mostly the addition of a few user stories as we figure out more features to incorporate and more optimizations that need to be made.
