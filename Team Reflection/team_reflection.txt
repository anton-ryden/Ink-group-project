Team Reflection - Group Ink

Each entry will be about 1 week apart.

-------Entry 1---------

This team reflection we discuss our application of scrum, design decisions and product structure and social contract and effort

Right now the scope of the project is rather small but we plan on expanding the further we go. the priority of features were discussed within the group. 
The features that are most vital for the project to work were labled with a higher priority and those that weren't with a lower. 

We haven't changed anything in our social contract but we have followed the rules it contains. Mainly booking meetings and everyone expressing their thoughts.
This week we spent about 7-8 hours and we believe we are on track. We have managed to set a foundation for our project and are ready for our first sprint.
Most importantly we want to learn as much as possible about working together in a group and programming. We will see this project as a success as long as the most vital user stories are completed.


We have decided to a class diagram to better agree on the structure of our code. We will mainly use trello for documentation, 
the trello will also be updated frequently whenever we think of something new or something that needs to be improved.
It will be difficult to ensure code quality but we will make sure to do rigorous testing and also have the PO check the final result if it works properly.

We devided the work in groups of 2. Where each group is responsible for several user stories. 
These user stories have an assigned PO which is one of the other groups. 
This allows us to work in smaller groups and share ideas/thoughts within your subgroup.
We used a trello board and took inspiration from a exercise session how the structure should look like. This made it possible
to come up with various epics and user stories.
